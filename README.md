# üèÅ Project Start: AQI Trend Analysis with ISR Policy Impact

## Overview
- This project analyzes the impact of California's 2006 ISR policy on air quality (AQI) trends.
- It uses LSTM, SARIMA modeling, hypothesis testing, and feature engineering for the analysis.
















## How to get started

# 1. Open&Run "1_Major Finding_T-testing hypothesis.ipynb"
Starting with SJV data from 1980 to 2025 that we have gathered during EDA stage, we have successfully deduced that AQI values-
has been significantly increased in all seven counties in San Joaquin Valley which sparked our initial hypothesis of this project.

# 9. Open&Run "9_Major Finding_Streamlit.app for Cross Comparison with Pima County.ipynb"
This notebook features fetching hourly sample data of PM2.5 of both Fresno and Pima county for cross validation/comparison-
to see if a presence of ISR in 2006 was exclusive factor for AQI improvement in Fresno county.
It also features how to deploy dual-map for cross comparison of Fresno county VS Pima cuonty AQI values on local.
